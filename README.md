# Sample Ember.js and Node.js app

Mark Watson March 14, 2013

A simple Ember.js and Node.js web app template - a minimal example of making a REST call from Ember.js back to a REST service in Node.js.

This project is intended as a short template project to start real web apps with.

Credits:

I read the book by Marc Bodmer "Instant Ember.js Application Development How-to":

http://www.packtpub.com/emberjs-application-development/book

before working through this example, and I used Marc's suggested setup for Ember.js projects, but I updated his example for ember.js 1.0rc1 and just used his basic setup.

# One time only: install modules

I assume that you have npm and Node.js installed. The run:

 npm install


# How to run

 node app.js

Then hit the URI:  http://localhost:3000/
